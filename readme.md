## A gRadual intRoduction to data visualization

Chester Ismay and Ted Laderas

Welcome! This is a workshop for the Cascadia R conference that is meant to be a gentle introduction to data visualization using the `ggplot` and the `plotly` packages. 

You'll learn the basics of the grammar of graphics and learn how to visualize and understand relationships between different kinds of variables in your dataset.
